# HuntTheWumpus

To compile and run:

javac -cp /usr/share/java/junit4.jar model/*java view/*java tests/*java

java view.WumpusGUIView

Program quirk:

Hit the tab key if nothing happens when the arrow keys are pressed. The arrow keys should show a text view of what is happening in game. Now click on the Images tab to play the game the way it was meant to be.

Credit goes to Rick Mercer for giving the assignment, and Zach Van Uum and Terron Ishihara for contributing to the development of the program.
